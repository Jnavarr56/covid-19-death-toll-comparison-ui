              <br />
              I spotted a Ruby on Rails job that I thought I would be great for
              and was about to apply but was worried that since I've been
              working with Node.js recently instead of Ruby (current project is
              a Node.js microservices based API), that the lack of a current
              Rails project would hurt my application. I'd been thinking about
              doing something with Covid-19 data so I quickly wrote a Ruby
              script to aggregate some death counts and then translated the
              functionality into an Ruby on Rails API application. I then build
              this simple React UI to pull data from that API.
              <br />
              <br />
              My thinking was that the CDC's data might show underreporting so I
              decided to compare it to other sources. Getting a definitive CDC
              figure was difficult so I decided to have the API scrape the CDC's
              HTML and use that as the figure.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Ruby on Rails API is containerized in a docker-compose network
              that also contains a Redis server, and is deployed on an AWS EC2
              instance running Amazon Linux 2. NGINX is used for routing/SSL
              proxying.
              <br />
              <br />
              The React UI uses Material-UI and is deployed on Netlify.
              <br />
              <br />
              You can send requests to the API from non-browser origins to:
              <ul>
                <li>https://api.coviddeathtollcomparison.com/results</li>
                <li>https://api.coviddeathtollcomparison.com/sources</li>
              </ul>

            <Typography variant="h4">Personal Info</Typography>
            <Divider className={classes.divider} fullWidth />
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom={true}>
              <ul>
                {LINKS.map((item) => (
                  <li key={item.label}>
                    <b>{item.label}</b>{" "}
                    <Link
                      className={classes.link}
                      label={item.label}
                      href={item.prefix + item.link}
                    >
                      {item.link}
                    </Link>
                  </li>
